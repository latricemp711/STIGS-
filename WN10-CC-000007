1. Tenable Discovered STIGS FAILURE WN10-CC-000007

Windows 10 must cover or disable the built-in or attached camera when not in use.

Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
RegistryPath\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore\webcam

Value Name: Value
Value Data: Deny

If "Value" is set to a value other than "Deny" and the collaborative computing device has not been authorized for use, this is a finding

2. Followed advice given from Tenanble in the Check column
3. Found that the path was already created: The below code set the value:

# Define registry path and desired value
$regPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore\webcam"


Set-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name "Value" -Value "Deny" -Type String -Force| Out-Null
 
4. Restarted the computer and check if value was there. The value was there
5. Run Tenable and WN10-CC-000007 passed
