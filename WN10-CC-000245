1. Tenable Discovered STIGS FAILURE WN10-CC-000245

The password manager function in the Edge browser must be disabled.


Disabling the Edge password manager will prevent this for the browser.
Check
Windows 10 LTSC\B versions do not include Microsoft Edge, this is NA for those systems.

If the following registry value does not exist or is not configured as specified, this is a finding.

Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Registry Path: \SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\MicrosoftEdge\Main\

Value Name: FormSuggest Passwords

Type: REG_SZ
Value: no
2. Followed advice given from Tenanble in the Check column
3. Found that the path SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\MicrosoftEdge\Main was not created: The below code set the value:


# Registry path for disabling ICS UI
$regPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\MicrosoftEdge\Main"

# Create the registry path if it doesn't exist
if (-not (Test-Path $regPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $regPath -Force | Out-Null
}

# Set the required registry value
Set-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name "FormSuggest Passwords" -Value "no" -Type String -Force| Out-Null

# Optional: Confirm the value was set
Get-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name "FormSuggest Passwords"
